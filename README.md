### 4. Likes and Comments

    -   **Post Likes**: Includes automatic scoring of posts to enable smart sorting of feeds.
    -   **Modern Comment Section**: Fully functional comment threads with nested replies and comment likes, providing a seamless user experience.

### 5. Mentions

-   Users can tag others in comments, enabling dynamic social interactions.

### 6. Bookmarks

-   Users can save posts into:
    -   Curated lists.
    -   Nested sublists for deeper organization.

### 7. App Notifications

    -   Likes, comments, replies, mentions, and more.

### 8. Back Office

### 9. Complete Backend

-   Thanks to **Replyke**, ReelSnap comes with a robust, plug-and-play backend. This project functions perfectly well without a server, making it easy to get started.
-   However, to enhance functionality and security, integrating a custom server can be highly beneficial. Visit the [Replyke documentation](https://docs.replyke.com/) to learn how to set up and extend your server.
